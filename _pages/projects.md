**Information Avoidance in Reciprocal Decisions**

In this paper, I document findings that show people may choose to avoid information about the consequences of a decision when it can signal an undesired characteristics like being selfish or betraying someone's trust. There is a clear pattern of behavior when avoiding information: people who make selfish decisions are more likely to avoid information. This behavior is observed even when the decision is already made and the information cannot change the outcome, particularly when information can show that the decision caused loss for someone else. This paper contributes to the behavioral and experimental research on information preferences and moral decisions by documenting that decisions may not only be motivated by the desire for certain outcomes but also desire to be regarded as a good person by oneself. 

**Strategic Curiosity : Information and Dishonesty - joint with Katrine Berg Nødvedt and Joel Berge**

This study provides experimental evidence on a novel phenomenon in information preferences: people strategically collect additional non-instrumental information to justify morally questionable decisions. We conduct a virtual dice-rolling experiment in which we vary the extent to which participants can collect additional information before reporting as well as the content of information. We document a tendency to systematically collect more information \textit{-be more curious-} when tempted to misreport. Curiosity is positively correlated with the size of the lie. Interestingly, neither curiosity nor dishonesty respond to the content of information as people roll the dice and misreport to the same extent even when information is irrelevant to the decision. Our study provides new insights into how individuals actively shape their information environment in pursuit of self-interest.

**Reasoning Avoidance - joint with Hallgeir Sjåstad and Steven Sloman**

This research project aims to investigate individuals' behavior when they are asked to explain a spurious relation between a main event and a side effect which can potentially challenge existing beliefs on the main event in an experimental setup. The main contribution of the present research is showing how causal relations can be misconceived by individuals when they challenge the beliefs and preferences about the main event -policy.
