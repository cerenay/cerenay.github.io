I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [Norwegian School of Economics, Department of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/en/departments/economics/){:target="\_blank"}. I am affiliated to the research group [FAIR - The Choice Lab](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/about/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My supervisor is [Erik Øiolf Sørensen](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/erik-oiolf-sorensen/){:target="\_blank"}. My main research interests are in the field of behavioral and experimental economics. My research particularly focuses on preferences over the information in relation to moral decisions.
