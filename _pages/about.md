I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Norwegian School of Economics. I am affiliated to the research group [FAIR - The Choice Lab](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/about/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My supervisor is [Erik Øiolf Sørensen](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/erik-oiolf-sorensen/){:target="\_blank"}. My main research interests are in the field of behavioral and experimental economics. My research particularly focuses on preferences over the information in relation to moral decisions. 
You can find my [CV here](/assets/pdf/Ay_CV.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

I will be attending the European Job Market for Economists 2020.
